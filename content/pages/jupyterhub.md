Title: JupyterHub
Summary: Instructions for accessing the course JupyterHub

In past years, we spent an unjustifiably large amount of time on installing
python packages on students' individual computers.
This year, we have decided to create a cloud-based environment from which
students can try the examples, complete assignments, and do any independent
work they want.

The cloud-based environment can be accessed at the following url:
** <https://rces.pangeo.io> **

This environment is a [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
a server which spawns individual Jupyter Labs for multiple users. It is based
on the [Zero-to-JupyterHub](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
project and deployed on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).
The resources for running this service are provided by the
[National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and Google via
[NSF Award 1740648](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1740648&HistoricalAwards=false).
